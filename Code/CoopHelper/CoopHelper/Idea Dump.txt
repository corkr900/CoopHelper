Something to require both players to be present

Synced Crumble Platform
	- would require IL hook on a coroutiune or totally custom

Synced key/door

Synced clutter

Synced move block

synced lightning breaker box

synced seeker
	- Would probably have to be only on 1 client at a time and bounce back and forth

synced temple cracked block

synced theo crystal

synced core blocks

synced jelly
	- conflict resolution necessary

synced puffer
	- conflict resolution necessary?

synced kevin
	- conflict resolution necessary

synced badeline booster

synced fling bird

role-specific  entity enabling (role flag?)
	- Just setting a flag would probably suffice

synced badeline boss
	- Attack target sync would be hard

something custom to be hostile toward other players >:)
