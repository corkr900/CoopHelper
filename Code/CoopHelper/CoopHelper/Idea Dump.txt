===== BUGS =====

- (!!!) crash from invalid header
	- Only synced stuff in the room were a seeker, temple block, clutter switch, and player
	- very very likely the seeker's fault
- steerable move blocks keep their offset on respawn
- Need to have some distinction of important / unimportant / buffered / unbuffered / stackable updates
- Need to remove frivolous dependencies from everest.yaml
- Keys used while you're out of the room aren't updated correctly
- Lock blocks can desync but idk how
- Persistent core mode should probably be moved to Session-level stuff
- Falling blocks aren't always synced (depending on how theyre triggered)
- breaker boxes
	- easy to desync with screen transition
	- persistent breaker boxes don't take effect until you enter the room they're in
- seekers
	- idle wobble is desynced
	- Sometimes animation gets frozen on one frame
	- Synced entities it interacts with don't have one single source of truth, can lead to weird behavior
	- Need to implement ownership changes
	- might need to handle pause?
- Kevins
	- Impacts should only be sent by the player that last bopped it
	- Conflict resolution probably necessary
- Clutter Switch
	- Lightning version doesn't work
