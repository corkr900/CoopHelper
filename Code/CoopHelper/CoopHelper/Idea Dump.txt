===== BUGS =====

- steerable move blocks keep their offset on respawn
- Need to have some distinction of important / unimportant / buffered / unbuffered / stackable updates
- Need to remove frivolous dependencies from everest.yaml
- Keys used while you're out of the room aren't updated correctly
- Lock blocks can desync but idk how
- Persistent core mode should probably be moved to Session-level stuff
- Falling blocks aren't always synced (depending on how theyre triggered)
- breaker boxes easy to desync with screen transition
- persistent breaker boxes don't take effect until you enter the room they're in
