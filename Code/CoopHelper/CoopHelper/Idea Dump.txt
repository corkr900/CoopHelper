============== BUGS ==============

- (!!!) crash from invalid header
	- Only synced stuff in the room were a seeker, temple block, clutter switch, and player
	- very likely the seeker's fault
- Steerable move blocks can desync easily when steering around corners
- Persistent core mode should probably be moved to Session-level stuff
- seekers
	- idle wobble is desynced
	- Sometimes animation gets frozen on one frame
	- Synced entities it interacts with don't have one single source of truth, can lead to weird behavior
	- Need to implement ownership changes
	- might need to handle pause?
- Clutter Switch
	- Lightning version doesn't work (removed from editor)
