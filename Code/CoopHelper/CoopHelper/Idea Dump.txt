===== BUGS =====

- steerable move blocks keep their offset on respawn
- Need to have some distinction of important / unimportant / buffered / unbuffered / stackable updates
- Need to remove frivolous dependencies
- Keys used while you're out of the room aren't update right (visual only)
- Persistent core mode should probably be moved to Session-level stuff
- Falling blocks aren't always synced (depending on how theyre triggered)
