============== BUGS ==============

- (!!!) session picker doesn't work if you connect to cnet after entering room (sometimes hard to reproduce)
- Steerable move blocks can desync easily when steering around corners
- seekers
	- idle wobble is desynced
	- Sometimes animation gets frozen on one frame
	- Synced entities it interacts with don't have one single source of truth, can lead to weird behavior
	- Need to implement ownership changes
	- might need to handle pause?
